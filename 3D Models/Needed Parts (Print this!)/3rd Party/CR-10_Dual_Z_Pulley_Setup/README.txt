# Summary

<b>Update:</b> I have completely redesigned this and posted as a new project https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2829855

As requested here are the files for the dual Z setup I recently set up.  One of my main design goals was to not use any set screws.  Here are the specific parts I used. 

Note: I used the factory Dual Z setup as a base, therefore a right side lead screw bracket wasn't needed.
