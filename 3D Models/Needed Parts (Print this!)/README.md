# 3D Printing instructions

All parts are mechanical parts and should be printed in the **final version** with ABS/PETG and 100% infill.

For **developing/testing purpose** I've made very good experiences with PLA and 20% infill. This is stable enough! :grimacing:



## Franken-10 Parts

All parts can be printed without supports - **except** `X-Holder Left-Front.stl`.
This part need support on the extension of the 2020 V-Type profile.

## Eccentric Eccentric_Spacer_Openbuilds__Makerslide

We need 2 parts for the second extruder.

## 5015 Bullseye Fans

Print the following parts (once):
- CR10_STOCK_MANUAL_BASE_V11.3.stl
- CR10TEVO_5015_DUCT_V7.5....stl
- Optional (for Autobed-Leveling):
  - ALL_18MM_EZABL_X+48_Y-2_RIGHT_V7.5..stl (for 18mm Probes)
  - ALL_13MM_EZABL_X+48_Y-2_RIGHT_7.5..stl (for 13mm Probes)

Then print again the following parts - but mirror them on the x-axis (for the 2nd extruder):
- CR10_STOCK_MANUAL_BASE_V11.3.stl
- CR10TEVO_5015_DUCT_V7.5....stl
