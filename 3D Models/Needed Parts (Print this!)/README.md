# 3D Printing instructions

All parts are mechanical parts and should be printed in the **final version** with ABS/PETG and 100% infill.

For **developing/testing purpose** I've made very good experiences with PLA and 20% infill. This is stable enough! :grimacing:

All parts can be printed without supports - **except** `X-Holder Left-Front.stl`. This part need support on the extension of the 2020 V-Type profile.
