# Summary

**This design solves all the basic necessities:**
- Fits almost every object with a flat top surface and printer frame when customized 
- Can easily hold the weight of 1+ kg spools
- Fits between other spools if necessary

**In addition to above criteria, I've optimized for:**

- Print quality: Friction-less rolling is achieved by adding bearings, no pulling required by extruder stepper motor

- Economic design: I've added holes in the guide to reduce material use and shorten print time without compromising strength. Since the guide has the longest printing time, I separated the guide from the brace. Just print multiple braces, and move the brace to the desired spot.

- Ease of use: Just place the guide in the bracket, hang the spool on the guide, and off you go. If there happens to be another guide right next to the one you want to use, you needn't move it out of the way. You can place the spool on top of two guides.

- Ease of printing: All objects are placed in such an orientation that requires the least amount of support, has the least amount of friction when using the holder and still get really strong parts!

This brace is made to fit around a 3/4"x 1.5", I will add braces for other 3D printers over time.

To complete Filler, you will also need two 608 bearings (can also be found in old skateboard/longboard wheels):

**UPDATE (27/07/2018)**
Added brace for Prusa i3 Mk2 & Mk3
Added brace for Anet A8

**UPDATE (30/07/2018)**
Added brace for printers using 2020 extruder aluminium (It's named CR10-Ender3)

**UPDATE (31/07/2018)**
Added wall mount

**UPDATE (05/08/2018)**
Added brace for the standard Creality3D metal plate included with the CR-10, Ender 3 and CR-X _(Thanks to the user Sw0rd for helping me design this one!)_

**UPDATE (06/08/2018)**
Added brace for the Ultimaker 2(+)

**UPDATE (26/08/2018)**
Added plastic bearing with increased friction. Use this when experiencing problems with normal bearings. You can add some graphite powder lubricant in between the roller and the plastic bearing for better rolling.

**UPDATE (30/09/2018)**
Added the source file for the brace (.step).

**UPDATE (17/11/2018)**
Added stand.

**UPDATE (20/03/2019)**
Added source files for all models (.step).

Please do not claim my model as your own or sell it :) 



# Print Settings

Printer: Anet A8
Rafts: No
Supports: Yes
Resolution: 0,2mm
Infill: 40-50% and 0%

Notes: 
For brace and guide:

- Wall Thickness: 1,2mm (3 parimeters)

- Infill pattern: Tri-hexagon

- Support pattern: Zig Zag

- Support density: 20-30%

- Buildplate adhesion: Skirt or Brim

- Material: PLA (any will do)

For roller, keep everything the same except:

- Wall thickness: 1,6mm (4 perimeters)

- Infill percentage: 0%!

- Buildplate adhesion: Brim
 
- Don't want to use support? Check out this Remix by EdNiedziejko (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3055046)

Keep all the parts in the given orientation, this ensures the best print quality!
