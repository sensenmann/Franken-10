## 3D Models
All parts are designed in Fusion360 and located in the git-repository.  
I'm quiet new to Fusion360, so some models are maybe constructed a little bit "strange" in the eyes of experts ðŸ˜…

At the moment, sensorless homing with `DUAL_X_CARRIAGE`enabled in Marlin wasn't possible for me, so I've had to make an workaround. You can find this fix in my commit **[150d5a9](https://github.com/sensenmann/Franken-10-Marlin/commit/150d5a96bf3c44fadcd32eb3756d982cddc0c70e)**.

I hope someone can help me to fix this workaround.
