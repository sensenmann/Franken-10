## Intention
I wanted to upgrade my awesome Creality CR-10 3D Printer to make it work with **dual X-Carriage** - but without building it completely up from the ground.
Also I want to keep the upgrades **cheap**, so everyone can easily join this journey.

At the moment, the overall costs for the needed parts is around **190€ - 320€**.

## Benefits
- TMC2130 upgrade
- Silent printing (thanks to TMC2130)
- Sensorless homing on X and Y
- Filament-Runout Sensor (by using existing endstops)
- 32 Bit Mainboard
- 2 independent extruders (fast switching)
- Autobedleveling and Mesh-Correction
- Basing on Marlin Firmware V2.0.1
- Using existing CR-10 Frame (no drilling, etc.)



## Needed parts
All needed and optionals parts can be found [here](Parts.md)


## Instructions
Do the CR-10 dual-z upgrade as instructed [here](https://www.sainsmart.com/blogs/news/how-to-install-dual-z-axis-to-upgrade-your-creality-cr-10-3d-printer).  
Skip the controlbox-steps and go directly to the step **Bracket installing**, as we have our own mainboard.

All other steps are documented in the **[manual](Docs)**
